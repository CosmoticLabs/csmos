Commands are the backbone of csmos. They are what you and your members run on your Discord server to interact with csmos. This is a tutorial on how to use them and how to view all commands that csmos supports.

## Two types of commands

csmos supports two types of commands:

- **Message commands** (sometimes referred to as **prefix commands**): Commands sent as a regular message. They usually start with your server's prefix (which is `;` by default) and end with a command. An example is `;help`.
- **Slash commands** (referred to by Discord as **interactions**): A native Discord feature that allow you to interact with the bots directly. You can type `/` and see all of the commands for csmos and all other bots in your server (which you don't need).

We recommend using slash commands, as they are simpler to use and, as stated before, are a native part of Discord, but we do support both.

:::note
If you want to learn more about slash commands, you can read [Discord's blog post about them and how they work](https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps?ref=badge).

## View all commands

To view all the commands csmos supports, you can run [`;help`](/commands/information/help) in your Discord server, and csmos will reply with a list of all its commands. You can also type `/` and click on csmos' avatar to see all of its slash commands.
